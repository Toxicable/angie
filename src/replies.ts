  'getting started': `To get started with Angular, do [Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html). After that, go through [Tour of Heroes (ToH)](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). Check the [Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/) for how to proceed after that. Good (often advanced) blogs are [Thoughtram](http://blog.thoughtram.io/exploring-angular-2/) and [Victor Savkin's blog](https://vsavkin.com/). A good starting point for a project is [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)`,
  'not enough info': `Please provide a brief description of what's going with the code. Pasting the error and saying "it's not working" doesn't help us help you. When did the problem start happening? Does it work if you remove/add some lines? Does it work in a different context? What have you tried so far?`,
  'create plunker': `It's very helpful to [create a plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5?p=catalogue) where you create a **minimal** reproduction of your problem, when possible. You're also likely to actually solve the problem yourself while doing so.`,
  'please format': `Please format your code. At the bottom-right of the chat's input box there is a \`M\` (Markdown) button which explains how to format snippets.`,
  'createg gist': `Please [create a gist](https://gist.github.com/) if your code is more than 8-10 lines long. It's difficult to keep track of the conversation in the chatroom when there is a huge block of code in the way. It's also difficult for us to look at your code this way.`,
  'not angular question': `For **ng-cli** related questions, see [angular-cli on gitter](https://gitter.im/angular/angular-cli). For **ng-bootstrap**, [open a question on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ng-bootstrap).`,
  'angular3': `There won't be Angular3. See more information on [Angular versions past version 2.x.x](http://angularjs.blogspot.co.nz/2016/12/ok-let-me-explain-its-going-to-be.html)`,
  'route reuse': `For more information on the Route Reuse Stratergy [please see here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41280471/how-to-implement-routereusestrategy-shoulddetach-for-specific-routes-in-angular/41515648#41515648)`,
  'track by': `\`trackBy:item?.id\` does not work, please see docs for more information: [Docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html)`,
  'angularjs': `This room is for Angular (version 2+), please visit [here for AngularJS](https://gitter.im/angular/angular.js)`,
  'noStoredReply': `I'm Sorry, I don't have a reply for that, i'm not very smart but you can help make me better by [contributing](https://github.com/Toxicable/angular-gitter-replybot)`,
  'global': `Global dosen't exist in Angular's context, there is only scoping. For example if you have 2 Modules, Module1 and Module2, if you import an external Module that has a component: \`<spinner></spinner>\` it is only avilable in Module1, you will have to import it into Module2 to access it there, please see the [FAQ](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ngmodule-faq.html) for more information`
